fish
----------------
fish is a Command Line Tool for interacting with DigitalOcean.

In order to use fish you'll need your api key and client id. These
can be found [here](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/api_access).

Note that you can only view an api key ONCE, so make sure you write
it down somewhere.

fish reads your config info from $HOME/.fish
